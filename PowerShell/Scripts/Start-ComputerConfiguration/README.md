# What this script does
The script configures baseline settings for a Windows device (including optional wifi profile in the Resources folder) and joins it to a local AD domain. It also installs software defined in subfolders that exist in the Software folder.

# What's included
- Resources folder that contains the wifi profile XML file. An example file is included.
- Script folder that contains the PS script file (including a Functions folder that the script depends on).
- Software folder that contains subfolders with installation files and a settings CSV file (to filter installation depending on manufacturer type and to add install arguments). Example subfolders are included.

# How to use
1. Copy all content to a USB drive. Do not change the file/folder structure (except subfolders in the Software folders).
1. Edit "Configure computer.bat" and set correct values for the variables (DOMAIN_NAME, DOMAIN_JOIN_ACCOUNT, DESKTOP_OU_PATH, LAPTOP_OU_PATH).
1. Launch "Configure computer.bat" from the freshly installed Windows device that should be configured.
1. Follow the script and answer its prompts to configure the device.
